## How to Use: Bonterms Standard End User Agreement

## Overview:
The Bonterms Standard Reseller Agreement (for Marketplaces) (Version 1.0) allows Providers in an online marketplace to appoint Resellers for transactions occurring within the Marketplace.

Once the Standard Reseller Agreement is implemented by the Marketplace, Providers can appoint Resellers through the Marketplace’s own systems (the “Marketplace Management Portal”). Alternatively, Providers may appoint a Reseller by signing a Cover Page.

Providers can customize the Standard Reseller Agreement through Provider-Specific Terms.

The Standard Reseller Agreement covers the basics of appointing the Reseller and use of Brand Elements, but orders and payments occur under the terms of the Marketplace.

The Marketplace itself does not enter into the Standard Reseller Agreement. Likewise, the Standard Reseller Agreement does not modify any other terms between (i) the Marketplace and the Provider or (ii) the Marketplace and the Reseller.

The Bonterms Standard Reseller Agreement is free to use by all parties under CC BY ND.
